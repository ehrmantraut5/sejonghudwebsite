## Getting help

### Discord Server

On the Redis Discord server, you can chat with members of the Redis community in real time. You'll meet Redis users, contributors, and developer advocates. This is a great place to stop in for quick questions or to share your latest Redis discoveries.

### Mailing list

Join the Redis mailing list to discuss the ongoing development of Redis and to find out about new Redis releases.

### Redis news

For occasional updates on the new Redis releases, you can either subscribe to the Redis mailing list or follow the Redis News Feed Twitter account.

To keep up with the latest from Redis Inc., including news on Redis Cloud and Redis Stack, consider following the Redis Twitter feed.

### Contributing to Redis

There are many ways to contribute to Redis, starting with documentation all the way to changes to the open source Redis server. Here are a few ways you can get involved.

### Reporting bugs

To report a bug in Redis, create a Redis Github issue.

For larger doc changes, we ask that you first create an issue describing your proposed changes. This is a good way to get feedback in advance to increase the likelihood that your changes will be accepted.
