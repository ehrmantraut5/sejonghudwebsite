# Inconvenience when we first met this UI
![inconv]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/incv1.png)

### Red part

There are so many irregular courses in the top part of list. If we want to access our course, we should scroll down again and again.

### Blue part

In this part, the tile with regulard course is extraordinary stretched along the width of website.

### Yellow part

Callendar is so small that we cannot observe our schedules directly.
